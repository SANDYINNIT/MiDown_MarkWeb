**IT WAS FUN THO**

### My Routine:
***[Monday-Friday]***

In these days I always wake up early around `6 a.m` to get ready for *College* which lasts around 6 hours, but in Wednesday I usually come back home an hour earlier! *(even if there's no College day I still try to wake up early)*

I mostly try to challenege myself so I go to the gym `3` times a week *I try to let my body rest 4 times a week*, in Monday, Wednesday and Friday... It lasts around 2 hours, sometimes I tend to go out with friends or just do my favorite thing, and that's called Skate! or just stay home and watch a Movie, series or of course perhaps just play video games.

When it comes to studying, I always study for about `3-4` hours a week, **however** if there is an deadline for an upcoming exam then I will definitely be studying 3 days earlier for the Exam.

***Saturday-Sunday***

These are mostly my resting days, in these days I mostly hangout with my family, rest my body, or I try to improve a language to its full potential.. And I also tend to tide up my house these days!.
